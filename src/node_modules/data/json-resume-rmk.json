    "summary": "Rob was born and raised in Pennsylvania, where he was introduced to computer programming at eight years of age. After voraciously self-educating for two decades, he sought professional help -- and graduated from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania with separate degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. He is best known among colleagues and educational faculty for his exceptional skills in analysis, debugging, and problem-solving. Among friends, however, he is better known for his empathy, even-handedness, and terrible puns. Rob's past work has focused on signal processing, pattern recognition, machine learning, and data warehousing; his active research aims to apply existing process-engineering and change-management technologies to the somewhat quixotic problem of universal individual empowerment. He is an ambitious, high-octane asset, and will never willingly experience complacency when faced with the opportunity for personal or professional development.",

      "summary": "Since my general education requirements were nearly completed before I arrived at Shippensburg, I had plenty of time to plan the education of my dreams and nightmares. This is a summary of independent or unusually ambitious projects and accomplishments achieved during my stay at Ship. Thanks are owed to the faculty, who supported my curiosity during in-major courses worth two degrees and nearly four full concentrations.",
      "highlights": [

        "Designed an instruction set and register file for single-cycle vector and matrix operations, leading a four-person team. Developed and tested an assembler and virtual machine supporting the new operations. There was no requirement in this project to support anything more complex than basic computation, and most teams consisted of two people. Everyone on the team enjoyed the repeated reuse of library code produced for this project.",
        "Designed and developed an embedded system implementing two-way serial communication using a single LED, controlled by two GPIO lines rather than one, for transmission and reception. Software performed automatic link-presence and link-loss detection, automatic re/synchronization in the presence of out-of-phase or drifting clocks, and full-duplex emulation over the timeshared optical medium (air). Constructed two prototypes on breadboard and achieved data rates of nearly 250bps. Yes, almost one quarter of a kilobit per second!",
        "Designed and completed a mathematics curriculum to develop, in both breadth and depth, skills relevant to theoretical computer science, beyond the level attainable through study of computer science alone. This curriculum included:",
        "... courses in abstract algebraic structures, intended to promote skills for algorithm design, problem-space transformations, and proofs of correctness.",
        "... courses in combinatorics and number theory, intended to promote skills for algorithmic analysis and proofs of optimality.",
        "... courses in linear algebra, probability theory, and statistical theory, intended to promote skills for simulation design and analysis, as well as comprehension of modern machine-learning, constraint-optimization, and planning algorithms.",
        "... courses in differential equations and modeling, intended to promote skills for signal processing, pattern recognition, numerical approximation and both continuous and discrete-event simulation.",
        "Personal Message: I had much fun, learned many things, and didn't care a whit about my GPA or what my paperwork would look like when I was finished. I was not present to get a degree, but rather to get an education. I explicitly succeeded in this ambition, and I attribute this to the fact that a passion for personal and professional development will take care of your education for you, but no amount of formal education will give you a passion for personal and professional development -- and there is always more to learn. The process of education is never, and should never, be over."
